COST EFFICIENCY STRATEGIES,,,
Intervention being analyzed,Title,Cost Driver (long text),Strategy (long text)
Access to Sanitation,Economies of scale,"Programs that serve more people, for longer, cost dramatically (up to 20 times) less per person/year of sanitation access, because management costs are spread over more clients.","When starting latrine construction projects, direct resources towards building the most durable latrines and serving the maximum number of people possible. Avoid implementing several smaller latrine-building projects across different grants."
Access to Sanitation,Spending on maintenance,"The number of people effectively served by latrines depends on their usable life and how well they are maintained. In the long run, it is more cost-efficient to spend “extra” money on maintenance since it extends the return on your investment over more years.","Avoid building temporary latrines wherever possible, and invest in more durable designs. Be sure to include funding for maintenance from the beginning of the project."
Access to Sanitation,Hygiene promotion activities,"Providing additional sanitation and hygiene promotion activities costs relatively little, while the benefit may be quite high: increased use of the latrines you have already invested in building.","Be sure to implement promotion activities any time you do latrine building and maintenance, to ensure maximum take-up of these services."
Child Protection Case Management,Wages for case workers,"Because the service being delivered is time with a case manager, national staff costs are often the largest expense for case management programs. Where wages for skilled case workers are higher, the cost per child served may be dramatically higher.","Where wages for case workers are high, try to shift administrative tasks to lower-cost administrative staff. You can be careful that your program is being assessed “fairly” by comparing results only to countries where case worker wages are similar."
Child Protection Case Management,Minimal economies of scale,"Because the largest cost is staff time, which scales directly with the number of children served, the cost per child does not fall very much when more children are reached by case management programs.","For case management programs for child protection, there is no minimum scale you must reach to achieve efficiency. Use your discretion to choose the reasonable targets, given your funding and context."
Child Protection Case Management,Training for case workers,"The cost of supplemental training to improve case worker skills may appear high in aggregate, but can actually be quite low per child served by those case workers.","When budgeting for trainings, figure out the cost per child served by the workers you might train. Then assess whether it’s worth spending this much to improve the quality of existing services, or if you should use the money to serve more children."
Family Planning Services,Long-lasting Family Planning methods,"Serving women with longer-lasting FP methods (e.g. IUDs, implants) is more cost-efficient. Even though the materials may be more closely, the one-time health service provides more years of protection against pregnancy.","Investments which enable you to provide longer-lasting FP methods (e.g. medical facilities to implant IUDs) can increase program cost-efficiency over time, by increasing the number of women who accept longer-lasting methods."
Family Planning Services,Achieving scale by increasing uptake,"To increase the number of people accessing the service, it is important to address the knowledge gaps about the value of using family planning. When more people use available services, the cost per person falls.","Spending on socializing new FP methods with communities, especially involving husbands and other community leaders, can be necessary to ensure that women take up services offered to them."
Legal Aid Case Management,Wages for legal staff,"Because the service being delivered is time with a lawyer, national staff costs are often the largest expense for legal case management programs. Where wages for lawyers are higher, the cost per case may be dramatically higher.","Where wages for lawyers are high, try to shift administrative tasks to lower-cost administrative staff. You can be careful that your program is being assessed “fairly” by comparing results only to countries where wages for lawyers are similar."
Legal Aid Case Management,Minimal economies of scale,"Because the largest cost is lawyers’ time, which scales directly with the number of cases served, the cost per case does not fall very much when more cases are served.","For legal case management, there are not big “returns to scale” beyond a certain point.To improve efficiency, make sure you are serving at least 300 cases with a given program, but pushing beyond that scale won’t improve efficiency further."
Legal Aid Case Management,Working through local partners,"Data from small sample analysis suggests that local partners can operate more cost-efficiently than INGOs, though this may have been due to the fact that local partners worked on different kinds of cases.","Delivering legal assistance through partners is likely to increase cost-efficiency in situations where they (1) can access populations we otherwise couldn’t, or (2) provide lower-skilled legal services which address large number of simpler cases."
GBV Case Management,Creating safe spaces,"Creating safe spaces by purchasing physical space specifically for women and adolescent girl survivors can cost a lot, but is an essential feature of service delivery.","Where you have invested in buying or building safe spaces, make use of those space to also run empowerment activities for women and girls or implement GBV awareness activities. This helps to maximize the value from these big investments."
GBV Case Management,Wages for case workers,"Because the service being delivered is time with a case manager, national staff costs are often the largest expense for case management programs. Where wages for skilled case workers are higher, the cost per child served may be dramatically higher.","Where wages for case workers are high, try to shift administrative tasks to lower-cost administrative staff. You can be careful that your program is being assessed “fairly” by comparing results only to countries where case worker wages are similar."
GBV Case Management,Integration with other services,"GBV case management programs are likely to be most efficient when integrated into existing sexual and reproductive health services, since this eases the referral pathway.",There are a number of important entry platforms that provide opportunities for the large-scale delivery of violence prevention programming.
Teacher Training,Scale of trainings,"Scale is important for cost-efficiency. Face-to-face trainings incur “fixed costs” such as venue rental or curriculum development. When these costs are spread over only a small number of participants, the cost-per-teacher can be very high.","If you implement face-to-face trainings, particularly with specially developed materials or in central locations, invite as many teachers as possible. For example, you could train extra teachers to deal with attrition, or include government teachers."
Teacher Training,Cost of training facilities,"The costs of renting facilities and bringing in outside facilitators can drive costs higher, especially as a proportion of the costs of smaller programs (i.e. reaching fewer teachers).","If you will have to pay out of pocket for a space or an outside facilitator, do this only in cases where you have larger cohorts to train. Otherwise, local sessions with community contributed spaces are likely to be more cost-efficient."
Teacher Training,Be careful comparing across training programs,"Teacher training programs can last from just one day to more than several weeks, so the cost per teacher may simply be driven by greater intensity of training.","Rather than comparing cost per teacher, be sure to look at cost per teacher per day."
Teacher Professional Development,Teacher Support Modality,"One-on-one coaching costs significantly more, per teacher per year, than decentralized modalities like Teacher Inquiry Groups(TIGs). A past study showed that one-on-one coaching cost almost 10x as much as TIGs.","Teacher Inquiry Groups are likely to be much more cost-efficient than one-on-one coaching, and you should consider whether they are a feasible approach to teacher support in your context."
Teacher Professional Development,Be careful comparing across programs,"Teacher support programs can last from just a few months to more than a year, so the cost per teacher may simply be driven by greater intensity of support.","Rather than comparing cost per teacher, be sure to look at the cost per teacher per yearof support. Comparisons with other programs will make the most sense when those programs provided similar frequency of support (e.g. biweekly, monthly, etc.)"
Malnutrition Treatment,Program “scale” is limited by context,"For center-based CMAM programs, your possible program scale is limited by the number of malnourished children in each catchment area. Because center fixed costs can’t be spread over as many children, programs in lower prevalence areas will cost more per child.","Be careful comparing the cost-efficiency of CMAM programs across contexts. When looking for comparison data, look for programs which operated in contexts with similar (1) population density, and (2) SAM prevalence, as your program."
Malnutrition Treatment,Better coverage means greater efficiency,"Malnutrition treatment programs cost less per child the more children we serve, but the number of children treated is determined by population density and the prevalence of malnutrition in the targeted areas.","In whatever context you are working in, focus on maximizing coverage rates at treatment centers. This will help you reach the most children possible, and drive down the cost per child as far as the context allows."
Unconditional Cash Transfer,Economies of scale,"Increasing the number of dollars distributed--by targeting more households, or giving more months of transfers--makes programs more cost-efficient, because ""fixed"" costs like program management and community assessments get spread over more transfers.","If your program serves 300 or fewer households, increase that number to get ""economies of scale."" Make best use of investments in community-level assessments and travel by serving all eligible households in that area before targeting new areas."
Unconditional Cash Transfer,Targeting methods,"In countries where the dollar value of transfers is low, intensive targeting can end up costing even more than the value of dollars transferred to beneficiaries, due to the costs of technical expertise and travel time.","If the value of transfers per household served is less than XYZ in total, aim for leaner targeting methods, such as community-level targeting or a reduced number of validations. Put this cost savings into serving more families with cash transfers."
Unconditional Cash Transfer,Taking dollar value into account,"The dollar value of transfers has an enormous impact on cost-efficiency--when we transfer more dollars to people (e.g. in contexts where basic needs cost more), then the costs of delivery simply get spread over more dollars of transfer.","Don't shift the value of transfers to improve cost efficiency--this should be based on local needs. Instead, take transfer size into account when presenting results to donors, and ensure that they compare only to programs with similar sized transfers."
